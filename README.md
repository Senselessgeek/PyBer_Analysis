PyBer Analysis

Overview of the analysis:
=

What my analysis tells me is that this course continues to mock my tuition by not having the data material match the course material.  The instructions for this challenge had examples as well as directions that do not work with the data set that was given to us.

Results:
=

The results show that it is not a good idea to do ride sharing unless you work in a small town, of which fare frequency will be low, but the chance to pick up a rider will be much higher.  Whereas in a bigger city, the total drivers increases reducing the amount of profit for individual drivers, while at the same time increasing the total fares, benefiting the company sponsoring the drivers.

Open PyBer_Challenge.ipynb for details on how the coding portion of the analysis was done.  For the conclusions, I used my eyeballs and my noggin.

Summary:
=

Ride Sharing companies should work to spread to as many big cities as possible to increase cash flow, while individual drivers may want to look at a better career.
